# Fake-Face Checker
An online, browser-based [Fake-Face Checker](https://tomhumphries.github.com/fake-detector) to detect fake portraits generated by [this-person-does-not-exist](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com).

## These people do not exist
All of these faces were generated by a computer.  
![faces](./public/images/faces.gif)
However, the program that generates the faces positions their eyes in the same location.  
This tool checks the locations of the eyes in an image to see if they match those generated by [this-person-does-not-exist](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com).

The current version of this script is easy to fool - all you have to do is crop the image slightly and the eyes will no longer be in the same location. **However**, all of the fake accounts I've encountered on LinkedIn havn't done this, and it successfully identifies them.

## Running locally
